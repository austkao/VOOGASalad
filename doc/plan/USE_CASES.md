write at least 40 use cases for your project that describe specific features you expect to complete. Focus on those features you plan to complete during the first implementation sprint, the next two weeks, (i.e., the project's core functionality, what must be written first to support the project's later features). Note, they can be similar to those given in the assignment specification, but should include more details based on your project's or genre's features and goals.
